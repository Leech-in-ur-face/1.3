osu!droid is a free-to-play circle clicking rhythm game for Android devices. It was a game hatched many years ago by the [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) community. This project is now being developed by a small group of fans and also with the help of foreign friends.

osu!droid relax is an experimental and unofficial beta of osu!droid, which allows you to submit scores using relax on a new server.
