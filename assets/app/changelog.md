osudroid!relax Changelog for v1.3 [Based on 1.6.8] (August 8, 2023)
=================== 

## Additions

- Added the experimental settings (not functionally working just yet)

## Changes

- Changed the way the cursor behaves (parity with rimu!)
- Reverted the Hard Rock (HR) mod multiplier back from 1.12x to 1.06x (rip new multiplier lol), why i actually did this because i thought it was 1.12x in stable or lazer, so i decided to revert it back.
- Reworked PP again (i didn't mention this update in v1.1)
- Made more options in the "Background Quality" option for further optimization
- Made more options in the "Playfield Size" option that gets minimally below 50% (it kinda look like a big area of a certain tablet)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where the game crashes after an update (i didn't mention this update in v1.1)
- Fixed a bug where the game crashes after playing a certain map with the relax mod

## Note

I released this too fast due to problems being reported during the first debug test. So for this version, this will be still a debug build, so likely there will be no updates for the server until i managed to figure out how to make one.

Oh yeah one more thing, if the problems still persist, please report it to me on discord: paytouse

Thank you and have a good day playing this game!
